# Synchronous-FIFO
The provided SystemVerilog testbench validates a synchronous FIFO module design with 8-bit data and a 32-word memory. It simulates clocked operations including reset, write, and read actions. The testbench monitors FIFO pointers and status signals, tracking the module's fullness and emptiness. Clock generation and signal initialization are included. The test sequence demonstrates write and read actions on the FIFO. This basic testbench serves as a foundation for verifying the functionality of the FIFO module in simulation, allowing for further expansion to encompass various test scenarios and corner cases.
